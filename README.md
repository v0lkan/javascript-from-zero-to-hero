## About

This repository contains the **source code** and the **starter files** of 
[JavaScript: from Zero to Hero](https://zerotohero.dev/).

It’s a **work-in-progress**, and it’ll be finalized and tagged once the course is
finalized.

## The Folder Structure of This Repo

The folders are grouped into “**sections**” and “**episodes**”. 

Every “**episode**” corresponds to a specific video lecture.

Each folder contains the **completed work** that you’ll achieve by the end of that
lecture.

To explain with an example:

* If you are looking for the **completed work** for the lesson “*S04E02: Configuring Prettier 
  for Visual Studio Code*”, then you’ll find it inside the folder `./S04/E02`.
* IF you want the **starter files** for the same lesson “*S04E02: Configuring Prettier for 
  Visual Studio Code*”, then it is **one folder before** in alphabetical order,
  which will be: `./S04/E01`. 

Before I launch the course, I’ll go through each of those folders one-by-one
following the videos, to clarify things, and fix errors, if any.

I may also add, important side-notes as **README**s into those folders.  

## Contributions and PRs

Since the code in the repo needs to stay in sync with the videos, I typically do
not accept PRs. 

Though, [you are welcome to create an issue][issue], and we
can discuss it further there.
